# Python + OpenCV

This test was developed in a Windows Pro 10 using [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

```
conda create --name pycv python=3.6
activate pycv
```

Then, Numpy, Matplotlib and Jupyter packages were installed as follow:

```
conda install numpy matplotlib jupyter
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

You can clone the notebook, source and images.

```
git clone https://<USERNAME>@github.com/vbarboza/pycv.git
cd pycv
```

And that's it! You can check for my solution notebook [here](https://github.com/vbarboza/idw/blob/master/pycv.ipynb)
or run it yourself.

```
jupyter notebook pycv.ipnb
```
