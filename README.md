# Python + OpenCV

This test was developed in a Windows Pro 10 using miniconda.

```
conda create --name pycv python=3.6
activate pycv
```

Then, Numpy, matplotlib and Jupyter notebook packages were installed as follow:

```
conda install numpy matplotlib jupyter
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

You can clone the notebook, source and images.

```
git clone https://vbarboza@github.com/vbarboza/pycv.git
cv pycv
```

And that's it!

```
jupyter notebook pycv.ipnb
```
